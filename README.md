# Colin's personal website

Hi. This is my personal website.

I built this by heavily relying on the Spotlight Tailwind UI site template, so a lot of thanks need to be given to the good folks over at TailwindCSS.


## Getting started

To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## License

The underlying Spotlight template is a commercial product and is licensed under the [Tailwind UI license](https://tailwindui.com/license).
