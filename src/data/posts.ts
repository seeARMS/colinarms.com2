// Paragraph's own `updatedAt` can't stand in for this: it also moves when a
// post's settings change. Every post's moved on September 27, 2026, when their
// canonical URLs were set, which would have called a 2021 post fresh.

// page still builds and stays in the sitemap, so links from elsewhere keep
// working and search engines keep indexing it. By slug on this site.
